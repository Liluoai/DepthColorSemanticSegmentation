# DepthColorSemanticSegmentation
This is a basic project to demonstrate the feasibility of the idea, which combining color and depth images to enhance semantic segmentation.

The result is shown in main.ipynb.

The Mask-RCNN part are modified from [this project](https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/tree/master/Mask-RCNN).
